Although it is the best of the initialization schemes, at least for the particular case of Kalkyotl, it is still prone to failures. In some cases if one or several of the distances to the stars fail to fall within the \"field-of-view\" of its parallax uncertainties (i.e. fall beyond 5-sigma) then the initialization will fail with errors like: \"Bad initial energy\" or \".rvel is zero\". In this cases launch the code again. Hopefully the initial position of the new run will fall closer to the \"field-of-view\" of the uncertainties.

    "The plot shows that source '4087735025198194176' has a nice mixing of the two chains. Concerning the cluster parameters we see that the location has still some correlations, which is causing the low effective sample size. Both the scale and rt parameters are fine, with some correlation still. The chains look fine and the Gelman-Rubin is also correct, if you still want to further improve convergence you can try with larger chains and more constraining priors."

    "\n",
    "As explained in the paper, the evidence module of Kalkayotl is there only to give you some help when deciding which prior family is the best one for your particular data set. It is computationally expensive, so if you have a large data set run the evidence only in a subsample of your data set (the `N_samples` parameter). The `M_samples` parameter controls how many samples fill be taken from the prior and then marginalized; a larger value implies more accurate results but also longer computing time. The rest of the parameters of the `evidence` function include specific parameters of the _dynesty_ code, these are the number of live points (`nlive`) and the convergence tolerance (`dlogz`). At the end an output file called 'Evidence.csv' will be created in the `dir_out` directory. "
